Second attemp in making a portfolio. I am not satisfied with my first attempt, so the purpose of this second attempt is to implement what I learned from my first attempt in order to create a better website. 
What I learned from my first attemp. 
1) Mastery of React-Spring.
2) More is not always better, sometimes simplicity is better. 
3) The difference between the use of the Golden Ratio for spacing is evident on websites. When not used the website feels unfinished and does not have the "feeling" of completeness. 
4) Typography choice is as important as design and color scheme choice.
5) Reduction in the time needed to develop.
